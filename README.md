# Horiseon Challenge

## Description

Project done using HTML, CSS, Github, GitLab on VS code. Purpose was to "clean up" code allowing it to be read more easily and to allow page to function more accesssibly. Some functional errors had to be corrected for instance the first nav button not being linked correctly. 
Dev elements were changed to semantic elements and spacing between code lines was added for ledgibility.
CSS code was shortened/replaced as needed, w/out impeding on function, even improving its functionability.

## Installation

First I created a repository, cloned it to my desktop, and added all the neccessary files. Ocne I had the HTML and CSS open in vs code and pushed to my Github, I previewed the webpage to assess its appearance and how it functioned. I added the necessary changes to the CSS and re-pushed it to github in its full functional capacity.





## Usage
As shown in the images, changes were made to the html tags (mainly div tags), turning them into 'semantic elements'
all changes made to html code were doctumented in code.
The css code was also simplified down, reducing redundant code.
